### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorite because I was able to write code that calculated the score of a Blackjack game. Although it was basic compared to the upgraded versions of this lab we did in the future, I enjoyed this one most because I used functions for the first time and it taught me a lot about how useful they are when running calculations.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 1 is my final choice because it stood out to me. Although it wasn't a fun game, I learned a very useful skill that I will be able to implement in future projects, both personal and professional. I am much more confident now in filtering through vectors after completing this lab.

* Lab 7
    
    Lab 7, Part 1 was another favorite because of how much we were able to improve our first Hi-Lo game. I found it really fun to write this code using for loops, and it helped me adjust to using command line arguments. Being able to use command line arguments helped make the code much simpler to write, and produced a cleaner way to execute the code as well.
